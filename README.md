# personal-blog

With this repository I want to challenge myself to apply the knowledge I obtained from the CodeGorilla Bootcamp in building a blog with authentication and authorization, CRUD and RESTful-routed. Will stick to the stack I have learned in the bootcamp sofar, but do intend to build another blog in the future venturing out into other languages and packages.
